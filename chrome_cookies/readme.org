* Intro
Reading this blog post ( https://blog.ankursundara.com/cookie-bugs/ ) I learned
about a value you can use as cookie name that partially corrupts ~document.cookie~.
There are plenty of other interesting topics in the blog post, highly recommend reading.

Basically if the cookie is set it is no longer possible to use ~document.cookie~ to read
cookies as it will always return an empty string. It is still possible to edit cookies given
we know their name and can access them that way. Also note that you cannot use DevTools
to delete or edit the cookie.

#+begin_src javascript
  > document.cookie = "a=b";
  > document.cookie;
  < 'a=b'
  > document.cookie = "\ud800=x";
  > document.cookie;
  < ''
  > document.cookie = "\ud800=;max-age=0";
  > document.cookie;
  < 'a=b'
#+end_src

Here is a short video that tries to give an overview of what this looks like.

*Disclaimer:*
#+begin_quote
What I'm looking at here is how different technologies react to these kinds of cookies.
At this time I don't think there is any new unexpected behaviour to be observed and I just
used this opportunity to explore different frameworks that were new to me.
Code is quite ugly, don't judge.
#+end_quote

Most tests have been performed with ~Chromium Version 112.0.5615.165~ but work on all recent
verions of Chrome and Browsers that use it as base. Firefox handles the cookie properly
and so far I was not able to test Safari.

* Which values show a similar behaviour?
Basically all Unicode Surrogate characters show the same behaviour. Here's the code I used to
identify them.

#+begin_src javascript
  for (let i = 0; i <= 0x10ffff; i++) {
      document.cookie = `${String.fromCodePoint(i)}=${i}`;
      let c = await cookieStore.getAll();
      amount_cookies = c.length;
      if (document.cookie == "") {
          //console.log(i + ": empty document.cookie string");
          if (amount_cookies > 0) {
              console.log(i + ": document.cookie empty but cookieStore not");
              document.cookie = `${String.fromCodePoint(i)}=${i};max-age=0`
              continue;
          }
      }
      document.cookie = `${String.fromCodePoint(i)}=${i};max-age=0`
  }
#+end_src

The same code can be ran with ~fromCharCode()~ instead of ~fromCodePoint()~ but as far as I can tell
this results in the same values but alot of duplicates that can be explained by this:
#+begin_src javascript
  > String.fromCharCode(0xd800) == String.fromCharCode(0xffd800);
  < true
#+end_src

This results in the following log files
[[file:example.com-1684776208717__fromCodePoint.log]]
[[file:example.com-1684771099249__fromCharCode.log]]

I used the fact that ~cookieStore~ still shows the cookies even when ~document.cookie~ is corrupted
altough it does so with an empty name.

* Setup
I used podman (alternative to Docker) to host various backends and observe how they handle the cookie.

*** Dockerfile Skeleton
#+begin_src
FROM php:latest
WORKDIR /usr/src/php_cookies
COPY . .
EXPOSE 9090
CMD ["php", "-S", "0.0.0.0:9090"]
#+end_src

*** Commands to build and run
#+begin_src bash
  podman build -t php_cookies .
  podman run -t -p 9090:9090 php_cookies
  podman kill -l
#+end_src
* PHP
** Pure
PHP's ~$_COOKIE~ shows 3 placeholder symbols for the provided value.
[[file:assets/php_base_2023-05-29_20-23.png]]

Using ~mb_ord()~ instead with encoding UTF-16 the returned value is ~int(60832)~.

I would assume this is due to the way PHP interprets UTF-16 values though I was not successful
in fixing this by declaring an encoding.

** TODO Laravel/Symfony
As far as I know both are popular frameworks and provide functionality to work with cookies.


* Node/Express JS
~cookie-parser~ seems to be the go-to way of working with cookies in nodeJS, using it to print
the value of the cookie we get the same values we saw in the pure PHP example.
#+begin_src javascript
{ 'í \x80': 'asd' }
#+end_src
[[file:assets/nodejs_cookie-parser_2023-05-29_22-34.png]]

* Go
Go's built-in ~Cookies()~ function (~net/http~) simply ignores the cookie in question but still
reliably returns other cookies.
Accessing the Cookie Header of the request directly results in the same 3 values we saw before.
#+begin_src
Cookie Header: [�=800]
Header Code Point: "\xed\xa0\x80"
#+end_src

** TODO Frameworks
Are there popular Go frameworks that are used when parsing cookies?

* TODO Non-Application Server
Do servers like Nginx/Apache regularly handle cookies and how do they react? 

* TODO Cookie Crawler/Blocker
Until I was asked how these react to the /weird/ cookie I was not aware they exist.
I didn't have the time to look into them as of now but more systems to throw cookies against
fits the theme.
